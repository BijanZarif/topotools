VMD topotools package. Version 1.1
Copyright (c) by 2009, 2010 Axel Kohlmeyer <akohlmey@gmail.com>
-------------------

A collection of tcl commands to manipulate and build 
topologies (i.e. bonds, angles, dihedrals, etc. and
their corresponding properties (type, order, etc.).

Please contact me, if you have any additional ideas
or want to implement a specific feature.

TODO:
  - improve "topo setbonds" to be more efficient for large sets 
    of bonds to be added.
  - topo copybonds <fromsel> <tosel>
  - topo guessbonds <sel>  (use bondsrecalc and restore bonds 
    outside the selection)
  - support for writing non-orthogonal cells
    (triclinic cell read is implemented and tested).
  - support for non-orthogonal cells with replicatemols.
  - support for generating and replicating bonds across
    periodic boundaries (for molecular crystal models).
  - proper documentation and a tutorial
  - more tools to read/write custom topology files 
    (e.g. gromacs top?, amber parmtop?)
